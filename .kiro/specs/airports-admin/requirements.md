# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive airports management system to the National Park Planner application. It includes a database table to store all airports information and an administrative interface for managing this data. The admin functionality is restricted to authorized users only, specifically the user "louis@eforge.us", ensuring secure content management while providing the foundation for airport optimization features in trip planning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store airports data in a structured database table, so that the application has a reliable data source for trip planning and airport optimization features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN there SHALL be an airports table in the database
2. WHEN an airport record is created THEN the system SHALL store IATA code, ICAO code, name, city, state/region, country, latitude, longitude, elevation, and timezone information
3. WHEN an airport record is created THEN the system SHALL automatically assign a unique ID and timestamps
4. WHEN querying airports THEN the system SHALL return data in a consistent, type-safe format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to access an admin interface for managing airports, so that I can maintain accurate and up-to-date airport information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authorized admin user navigates to the admin section THEN the system SHALL display an airports management interface
2. WHEN viewing the admin interface THEN the system SHALL show a list of all airports with key information
3. WHEN an admin wants to add an airport THEN the system SHALL provide a form with all required fields
4. WHEN an admin wants to edit an airport THEN the system SHALL pre-populate a form with existing data
5. WHEN an admin wants to delete an airport THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before removal

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want admin access restricted to authorized users only, so that sensitive management functions are secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user tries to access admin functions THEN the system SHALL verify their email is "louis@eforge.us"
2. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts admin access THEN the system SHALL redirect them with a 404 message so that they have no indication that the tool exists
3. WHEN checking admin permissions THEN the system SHALL validate both authentication and authorization
4. WHEN admin routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce security checks on every request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create new airport records, so that I can add airports to the system as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new airport THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are provided
2. WHEN submitting a new airport form THEN the system SHALL save the data to the database
3. WHEN an airport is successfully created THEN the system SHALL display a success message and redirect to the airports list
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages for each invalid field
5. WHEN creating an airport THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate IATA codes and ICAO codes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to edit existing airport records, so that I can keep airport information current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing an airport THEN the system SHALL load the current data into the form
2. WHEN updating airport information THEN the system SHALL validate the changes before saving
3. WHEN an update is successful THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation message
4. WHEN editing fails due to validation THEN the system SHALL preserve user input and show error messages
5. WHEN updating an airport THEN the system SHALL maintain the original creation timestamp

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to delete airport records, so that I can remove outdated or incorrect entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a delete action THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with airport details
2. WHEN confirming deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the airport from the database
3. WHEN deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success message and update the airports list
4. WHEN canceling deletion THEN the system SHALL return to the airports list without changes
5. WHEN an airport has associated trip data THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show an appropriate message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view all airports in an organized list, so that I can easily browse and manage the airport data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the airports list THEN the system SHALL display airports in a table format with key information
2. WHEN the list loads THEN the system SHALL show IATA code, airport name, city, state/region, country, and action buttons
3. WHEN there are many airports THEN the system SHALL provide pagination or efficient scrolling
4. WHEN searching for airports THEN the system SHALL filter results by IATA code, name, city, or state
5. WHEN the list is empty THEN the system SHALL show a message encouraging the admin to add airports

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to search and filter airports efficiently, so that I can quickly find specific airports in a large dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching airports THEN the system SHALL support filtering by IATA code, ICAO code, airport name, city, state, and country
2. WHEN entering search terms THEN the system SHALL provide real-time filtering of results
3. WHEN clearing search filters THEN the system SHALL return to showing all airports
4. WHEN no airports match search criteria THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results" message
5. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL maintain search state during navigation between pages
