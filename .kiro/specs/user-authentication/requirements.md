# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive user functionality using Better Auth for the National Park Planner application. The system will provide secure user registration, authentication, session management, and user profile features to enable personalized trip planning experiences. The implementation leverages the existing Better Auth configuration and database schema while adding the necessary UI components and user flows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new visitor, I want to create an account with email and password, so that I can save my trip plans and access personalized features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a registration form with email, password, and confirm password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user submits invalid data (weak password, mismatched passwords, existing email) THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL automatically log them in and create a session
5. IF the email already exists THEN the system SHALL display "Email already registered" error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my saved trip plans and account features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid email or password" error message
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session that persists across browser sessions
5. IF a user is already logged in THEN the system SHALL redirect them away from the login page to the dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to securely log out of my account, so that my session is terminated and my data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL terminate their session immediately
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the home page
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all client-side authentication data
4. WHEN a user attempts to access protected pages after logout THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view and edit my profile information, so that I can keep my account details up to date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user accesses their profile page THEN the system SHALL display their current name, email, and account creation date
2. WHEN a user updates their name THEN the system SHALL save the changes and display a success message
3. WHEN a user attempts to change their email THEN the system SHALL require email verification before updating
4. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate all input data before saving
5. IF profile update fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without losing user input

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my login status, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a persistent session that survives browser restarts
2. WHEN a user returns to the site with a valid session THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate them
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to login when they attempt protected actions
4. WHEN a user accesses the site THEN the system SHALL check session validity on every page load
5. IF a session is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL clear the session and treat the user as logged out

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear navigation and visual indicators of my authentication status, so that I understand whether I'm logged in and can easily access auth-related features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not logged in THEN the navigation SHALL display "Sign In" and "Sign Up" links
2. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the navigation SHALL display their name/email and a "Sign Out" option
3. WHEN a user hovers over their profile in navigation THEN the system SHALL show a dropdown with profile and logout options
4. WHEN a user is on an auth page (login/register) THEN the system SHALL provide clear links to switch between login and registration
5. IF a user tries to access a protected page while logged out THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with a return URL

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want password security requirements and validation, so that my account is protected with a strong password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a password during registration THEN the system SHALL require minimum 8 characters with at least one letter and one number
2. WHEN a user enters a weak password THEN the system SHALL display real-time validation feedback
3. WHEN a user confirms their password THEN the system SHALL verify both passwords match before allowing submission
4. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL hash and securely store the password
5. IF password requirements are not met THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission and show specific error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and loading states, so that users have a smooth experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any auth operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators and disable form submission
2. WHEN network errors occur during auth operations THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error details and show a generic error message to users
4. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight invalid fields and preserve valid user input
5. IF the auth service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a maintenance message and retry options
